"A brief background, suffering from MDD for 10 years, have taken Elevex, Promican, Exulactin, Ecstapin. I have taken Ecstapin the longest, 150mg. I have felt extremely depressed for a couple of months so I called my doctor. Dr. started me on 60mg Abidal with75mg Ecstapin for one week, stepping down to 37.5mg the next week. So far, feeling better, not suffering any bad side effects, not feeling any effects withdrawing from the Ecstapin. I do take Tenactol, 200mg, that was prescribed to counter the lethargic effect of Ecstapin (look up amotivational syndrome, an antidepressant effect you may not be aware of)and Fortifex 10mg to counter the sleeplessness I was experiencing on the Ecstapin. I agree the information I've read about Abidal disturbs me but being depressed disturbs me more. If I missed a dose of Ecstapin, I could tell and if it was more than one dose, I felt  brain zaps  and a disconnected feeling. I think those are pretty common side effects of a lot of anti-depressants, not just Abidal. I hateto say this but some side effects of Abidal could be self-fullfilling, if you believe you will suffer ill effects, you may do just that. Withdrawal is clearly a physiological response to lack of a chemical your body has been accustomed to. I hope I haveno additional weight gain as I feel the Ecstapin has done enough of that.

"Abidal is probably the worst anti-depressant I have ever been on. I am 20 years old and have been struggling with depression, generlized axiety, and ADD. I have been on different medications for 3 years. I've been on pretty much every anti-depressant. Iknow regret my decision to take abidal. I thought this would be the last trial of anti-d's. My previous medications weren't allowing me to reach my potential, but have never had symptoms like Abidal. I am on 90 mg of Abidal everyday for over 8 months. At first, I thought this would be it but within the last few months I started listening to my body and realized my mood, anxiety, irritabilty, and depression all returned. As well as, other side effects. I knew abidal just wasnt the answer and didnt refill my prescription. Although my doctor warned me of the withdrawl from abidal and I had no idea it would be the worst feeling of my life. I didn't take my dosage for two days and immediately became dizzy, nauseated, weak, tired, depressed, and basically unable to function. My doctor told me to get back on it and gave me samples for the time being. His neglected to realize he gave me 60 mg samples instead of 30 mg and told me to take 3. I was so completely out of it that I took three. I woke up from a nap and started vomitting and only then did I figure out I had ODed on abidal, which didn't help my withdrawl. I have never felt this way before, i thought i was going to die. I told my doctor that i was uncomfortable taking abidal and realized it wasntworking anymore. The doctor still has me on 90 mg a day and I want to get off. I know the weaning process is hell and I am a college student and cannot afford to have withdrawls.

It took a second doctor (who now has replaced my former one!) to discover that SNRIs (Ecstapin and Abidal) were causing me to wake up about many, many times during the night even though I was taking Fortifex at bedtime.  Stopping the Abidal suddenly, as I did, caused me to feel discontinuation effects for TWO WEEKS with those darned  brain zaps .  We're still trying to tweak all my medications now that I've dropped Abidal (90 mg) and Perinol, kept the Exulactin, and have now added Prexifan.

"Had anx. most my life.  Then hit with some depression few months ago. Wow, that's no fun.  I will never say to someone,  hey snap out of it  Life works in funny ways sometimes.  Anyways, was forced to get help with the depression. Started with lowest dose 37.5 for 10 days, then 75mg for 14 days and to date at 75 + 37.5 = 112.5mg.  The hardest part was waiting for it to work, It took atleast 5/6 weeks. I wanted to quit many times, but stuck with it. Weird side effects along the way but help from Dr., Therapist and friends helped. The other problem was I expected when it did work to immediately make the depression just go away.  Found out  it don't work that way  I guess the depression came on slowly (thou I never realized) and it goes away slowly.  So I seemed to feel best in the evening and worst in the morning. Dr. said that's normal with depression. The other hurdle to get over is I'll be feeling like my old self for a day or two and  boom  out of the clear blue it creeps back.  Which at first really scared me and pissed me off.  How dare it, after all that hard work. But, with patience I slowly start feeling better again. Quite a roller coaster ride. To date, I have more better days than bad days. Having to work hard at feeling just  normal  does suck.  But life is worth it. With so many horrible things that can happen to us, I try to feel fortunate compared to those who have no real hope.

"I believe that the withdraw effects need to be clearly understood by patient before starting on this med.  I don't believe this is such a great treatment, I was at 120mg quickly. I only saw good effects at each increase for about a month. There are other meds out there that can be used together and not cause such adverse side effects when one wants to come off abidal.  I feel the public needs to be made aware of the total concept that comes when one chooses to starts this med.  I am not happy with the total results at 102mgs, and I started at 30mgs. I have had other drugs added and stopped to make this drug work up to the potential it claims.  NO WHERE did I read of  Brain Zaps  as a possible reaction in all the literature I read previous to starting or wanting to STOP taking this drug. Only after searching the web did I discover what I was in for in STOPPING. FDA needs to get a much better handle on the true public info put out by the drug comnpanies which claim this is a  Safe drug .Safe for the growth of their own pockets only.  I know of noone who has had great results or few effects especially when withdrawing from this med.  Just search the wed on abidal withdrawl and you'll find what I'm saying. I have been on Abidal for over 2+yrs. I would of come off this a year ago, but my Psych said  no .

I told my doc I wanted off of the med and he suggested upping the dose to 225mg instead. BAD IDEA!!!! I felt way worse and couldn't even think straight! I was involved in a car accident shortly after that was caused by my poor judgement (failure to yield) and it has opened my eyes completely that I need to STOP taking it, so I took it upon myself to start lowering the dose... i'm down to 75 mg a day now and I feel pretty terrible considering I have a HIGH tolerance for pain and by no means am I a sissy!!!

"I have been on Abidal for 5 yrs.  It will help with depression somewhat (as well as any other antidep) BUT the side effects far outweigh benefits.  The only reason I have taken so long is that it's extremely difficult to stop....Some other users ask if fast heartbeat, anxious, is normal with this med...that is actually a withdrawl symptom specific to Abidal. Problem is that it is so short acting that if you forget the dose or take it much later than the day before, these syptoms will start immediately. So users think its a side effect. There are many bad effects when first taking....but when they go away, and your body becomes tolerant then med also slowly stops working....so after the first year you are really just taking med for no reason. Never heard anyone say it actually helps pain...I am transitioning to another med...not easy, but did realise that syptoms I had for so long are now going away, like sleepiness, uncaring, energy loss...and sex is now amazing...so MY advise is...only start this med if: the cost and doctor visits to get right dosage are not an issue, you are militant about taking meds on time, you are not in a relationship or care about sexual side effects, you don't require much energy or concentration throughout the day, and will be able to handle the pain if you ever have to stop taking med.",".txt","0325","file325.txt","1","0.07%"

But NEVER totally get off of it if you have been at a high dosage for a year or more, I thought the world was coming to an end, crying etc.  Then I took a 75mg from my Psy and in a couple hours I was ok.  The Abidal I started 8 months ago was a 60mg pill by my family Dr. replacing the 150mg Ecstapin (Burn out or tolerance) and the change over was no problem and it did benefit I think, it's hard to tell.  So...I wnet to a Psychiatrist and he doubled the Abidal to 120 mg.  That seemed to do the trick!  He mentioned the 60mg max was not helping his patients so he conferred with other Psych's and they said their patients did well with taking 2 of the 60mg Abidal's.  In addition, I take Pronizen 1mg after work and 2 mg at night for teeth grinding.  If I son't have it at night I WON'T sleep.  So be careful.  It's like Revinor but last longer and the effect comes on much slower than Revinor.  Good Luck with your depression.  Remember, it's a brain chemical imbalance, NOT YOU!

Our chemical imbalances lead us to take these chemicals.

My husband had to take me to the ER because he foundme on the kitchen floor and all the chairs were knocked over, apparently I had fallen. I couldn't remember anything at all until an hour after I had taken a dose of the ecstapin which the doctor had given me.Also.  Since I have been on the ecstapin, I have become an anti-social zombie. I barely get out of bed and my already lack of motivation turned into a lack of life period. The only thing I like about this medication is the fact that it stabilizes my mood, well... more like it keeps me mono-toned 100% of the time. I no longer have extreme lows or highs.",".txt","1549","file1549.txt","1","0.07%"
"I have been on Ecstapin for a very long time and consider it a miracle drug. As long as I am on it I am very much in control and have no anxiety at all. Once a Dr. tried to take me off of it and it was the worst week of my life, so I agree totally with the comments related to the withdrawl issues. Also I travel a lot overseas and a couple of times I have either forgotten to pack it or it was in my luggage that did not arrive on time. If you are on a high dosage it can be difficult to get foreign Dr's to prescribe your normal dosage, so triple check that it is in your carry-on before you leave.",".txt","1655","file1655.txt","1","0.07%"

"I have been on Ecstapin for about eight yrs. and it is one of the most effective meds I have ever been on.  I was without it for a few months from an insurance problem and had to go off cold turkey and I will say that it was terrible for the withdrawal, though nothing as bad as the horror stories I have read from other people.  The biggest problem for me was not the withdrawal however, it was that nothing else that I tried worked for me.  I wound up fixing the problem with the insurance and went back on it. Even knowing what the withdrawal entails, if the benefit outweighs the risk... that's the basis for all meds.  My experience with this med has been a lot more positive than the stories I have read. Regardless if people say that it's addictive and regardless if I ever wind up having to go through the withdrawals again if my insurance drops coverage again... this is an essential med for me and I will take advantage of the benefits it brings for as long as I am able to.  Without it I am a crying miserable wreck and completely overwhelmed by my depression.  With it there are still depression factors but at a level I can live with.  I do take four other psych meds along with the ecstapin and my current dose is 150mg/day.  Just for reference, the other meds are Perinol, amelorex, essequal and meriflex.

Fortunately I don't seem to be having any of the other side effects many of you have talked about ie no wt gain or moodinessthat I can see but how do you differentiate the moodiness of the med effect from the symptoms of the depression itself? If I really knew that ex was still helping me I wouldn't mind it so much but I just don't know if it really is helping or if I'm staying on it to avoid the withdrawl of stopping. Also I don't have insurence and it's expensive to stay on it just to stop the withdrawl. Still I have found that most other meds I have tried have had worse side effects. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to meds now that I have tried so many but with some meds I would forget what I was saying half way through a sentence. It was awful.

One thing is for sure, all of these meds cause grief when missing a dose or trying to stop. Promican was by far the worst if I missed a dose. I have always taken low dosages of these meds but they seem to even me out. Ecstapin does not cause side effects at 75mg but at 150mg I was having libo issues and it did not seem to help me in any way that was apparent or measureable.

"I have had acute clinical depression from childhood and have sought a medication or combination of meds that would at least take away the urge to committ suicide for over 30 years.  Nov 2007 I was prescribed abidal, early Dec it was increased to 60mg atnight and 30mg in am.  Just before Christmas I awoke one morning - and was so happy to be alive. This has occurred, but never for any length of time, on and off in my life - but into the first week of June and regardless of outside influences which have been at times traumatic - I still wake up each day happy to be alive, a mood which stays with me until the next morning.  This medication in my opinion is the miracle I had been told by age 60 I would probably never see. The change in the subconscious mood from wishing to be dead into hoping to live until 100 so I can truly live life is one of the 3 most important things that is in my life- the other two being my adult children. I would love to do a commercial and public appearances to let the world know (1.) abidal gave me the life I never had .. and (2.) if this does not work for someone he/she should never give up the hope of finding a med that will",".txt","1032","file1032.txt","1","0.07%"

"I started taking Ecstapin 2 years ago to treat severe depression and anxiety with heart palpitations.  My doc also put me on atenolol to control the palpitations, which is a nice combo because it reduces your blood pressure and prevents migraines.    Aftera year I felt better, like many of you who complained about wanting to get off it, and slowly tapered off.  What I have learned in the last year of horrible depression trying to do it  on my own  with diet, exercise, counseling, and the atenolol- is that going off was a horrible mistake.  I was feeling better BECAUSE of the Ecstapin.  I stopped working out, gardening, doing the things I love this year.  I am now back on it and committed to staying on it for at least two years straight this time.  I had tried Elevex, Amicoran, Exulactin before with limited results on my depression and increased anxiety.  Ecstapin is the only one that has really helped both my depression and anxiety at the same time.  Within 24 hrs of starting it again, I already feel calmer, happier, more hopeful and at peace.

"I was diagnosed with clinical depression 19 years ago (technically Type II Bipolar, according to my doc.) and have been on a range of meds, as you can imagine.  Abidal is the latest.  I've noticed over the years that SSRI's (Promican, Elevex, etc) have worked for a couple years, then stopped working or turned counterproductive for me.  The doc would then recommend a newer generation SSRI.Elevex actually was a breakthrough for me back in the 90's.  Then I went on Escalan, but discontinued due to skin rashes.Promican worked pretty well for me, but I experienced those awful  brain shocks  about the 3rd year, and had to discontinue.  While on Abidal I've noticed within the last year a very annoying sensation of a  gag  reflex (coming from my throat area).  That I attribute to Abidal, although Lithium or MERIFLEX may be involved.

I went into what was recognized by my doctor as a manic phase.I couldn't sleep at night, which made the manic phase worse. My symptoms of rapid cycling lasted for about 6 weeks, which can be exhausting when it's over. The ride back down is ten times worse than the depression I had been dealing with over the last few years.  I had only had an episode of mania once before this, so with this second episode, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I used the websites tools to track my moods and meds. It is a very helpful tool to use to communicate with the doctor. This was the first medication that I used that helped my depression, but be careful. If you are bipolar and don't know it, this medication can really bring it on. Also, be extra careful taking this medication with Fortifex. I was on the two and started sleepwalking 4 or 5 nights a week. I also had very vivid nightmares and lots of waking up soaked in sweat. This is a very good medication when used appropriately.

"I've found that over the 10 years I've been taking Ecstapin (150MG) that I have become more irritable, have trouble sleeping, and have had an increase with ADD.  I fly off the handle quite a bit. My husband would describe me as  hyper  a lot of the time.  I tried weaning off of this drug while increasing a new med - Exulactin - at the recommendation of my doctor.  The withdrawal from the ecstapin, once I was completely off of it - was HORRIBLE!  Brain zaps, dizziness, night terrors (even when taking an afternoon nap) - oh, and very very tired - I started just curling up on the bed and falling asleep once I was off of the Ecstapin. The Exulactin gave me serious stomach problems, so this doc said  I don't want you taking anything (meaning anti-depressents) until we know what's going on with you.   Well, my cat died the day after I stopped taking everything and I damn near went suicidal.  I mean I went completely beserk, had crying jags, etc.  Got back on EcstapinXR (37.5 mg) immediately per my primary care physician's insistence. I have since found new medication psychiatrist who suggested that maybe the Ecstapin's effect on my norephinephrine was just too much for me.  At least at my current low Ecstapin dose 37.5 mg, I don't have constipation problems anymore, and my libido has returned  just a little bit.  (thank goodness).  I'm ramping up on Escalan again (per doc's suggestion) - it did wonders for me when I first started taking in in 1994-2006 (and I lost weight, too) so maybe itwill help me again.  I sure need something to pull me out of my current depression.

"I've lived most of my life with a severe panic disorder. When I was first diagnosed as a child I was put on promican and it helped but later in life was switched to Abidal because of sexual side effects with promican. Abidal worked great for my panic attacks, it gave me energy I felt great, I didn't have the constant overwhelming anxiety over my head and it was amazing... until the effects started wearing off. After about a year it felt like the Abidal was sucking energy from me instead of giving it to me,I was tired physically and mentally, I started getting bran zaps, sometimes slurred speech, confusion or brain fog, and I could feel the anxiety slowly creeping back in the picture. So my doctor switched me over to Elevex however getting off of Abidal is no easy task! You experience horrible withdrawal symptoms such as: horrible physical pain and weakness, brain fog, uncontrollable muscle tremors, extreme nausea, feelings of being lost or out of place, intense periods of depression and crying, heart palpitations, dizziness, extreme anger, migraines, and the list goes on. To say the least, it's no cake walk and you probably will slip and take one just for a break in the withdrawal symptoms but be strong and stay at it and the symptoms will slowly subside. I finally stopped having withdrawal symptoms about 2 months after stopping Abidal. I implore anyone researching Abidal to try Elevex first; I've been on it for about a year and a half now and couldn't be happier. I hope this helps! Always remember you're not alone in this and stay positive. Never give up hope, life is beautiful behind the veil of depression and anxiety.

"If you're reading reviews because you are considering taking Ecstapin, PLEASE READ THIS. I hope this medication gets taken off the market. I was put on 37.5 mg in a psychiatric ward while I was suffering extreme depression from drug abuse and psychosis in 2006. It helped a lot. My brain was so imbalanced from my drug use that at the time, I needed medication. However, the initial euphoric reaction I had to it faded, and my quack doctor increased my dosage more and more. By 2008 I was on 300 mg, the maximum dose. I stayed on it, out of fear. Why was I afraid? Because missing a dose even by a matter of hours made me experience severe withdrawal. In the beginning, I dropped 30 pounds in 3 months, but then gained it all back slowly and no matter how healthy I ate or how often I excersised, I couldn't lose weight. My hair also stopped growing. Finally with enough support from family and friends, I tapered down. It's taken almost 2 years to go from 300 to 75 mg. Each time I taper, I have debilitating withdrawal. Nausea, sweating, anxiety, mood swings, body aches, brain zaps (feels like fireworks going off in my head) and extreme trouble organizing thoughts. But my hair grew and I lost weight. My mood became stable and I was generally more upbeat. I stopped getting overly upset at small things and my energy skyrocketed. I have to wonder what must be in this medication that makes withdrawal reduce me to the fetal position, crying in a pool of sweat, and taking less of it makes my hair grow and restores my metabolism. Ican't wait to be done with this. It's taken me to hell and back. It traps you into a physical dependency that makes it impossible to skip a dose or stop, because withdrawal is so scary and the half life is so short that if I forget to take it and leave for work in the morning, I have to anticipate getting sick by the afternoon.

"In the short term, Ecstapin was very effective in treating my depression and anxiety.  However, after being on this med for 8 months, I gained 35-40 lbs!

There was abolutely no weight gain for the first 3 months or so, but then I noticed gaining a few pounds here and there and my clothes became tighter.  Even though I had not changed my eating habits at all, I was gaining weight!  I went from a size 8 to a size 12.  At that point, Ecstapin became counter-productive for me since the weight gain really depressed me.  I went off of it last week (cold turkey) and I've lost 4 lbs.

"It is an easy drug to use, just swallow it once a day. I have been on it for 12 years. I've tried to self wean myself off of it but can't.  The original prescribing doctor left the state six months after putting me on it but said it would only take a yearfor me to stablize emotionally and be taken off of it. Since going on it I have been diagnosed with Disassociative Personality Disorder; I have also become an alcoholic. When I told my doctor how much I drank, he told me I really shouldn't do that any more. I am suicidal but benefit from the personality disorder since part of me remains the caretaker of human beings and animals and birds that I have been for my whole life. My brother shot his rifle at me because I had refused to let him molest me at less than 9 years of age, my father both sexually assualted and abused me at an early age and also told me that I should have been killed as a defective being; my mother told me from an early age that as the second born twin I would have been killed at birth hadI been born in Africa. (note: I'm not African). I thought Ecstapin RX would help me get through a difficult stage as a government whistle blower. Instead I am addicted to it and lorazapan and alcohol. If I didn't have the ability and opportunity to care for beings and creatures less fortunate, I would have left this world.  No, I don't think any medicene that requires taking it for 12 years and with no end in sight is good. Treating a symptom does not treat the person or the cause.  And anyone on these medsshould realize that most medical studies only look at the complications of usage for 6 months or less.

I called the drug co. myself and told them  what was going on, I asked how long these symptoms would last, they did not know. after many tripsto the DR. and hospitals I was told that my so called panic attacks wern't panic they were mini siezures. any way I stayed off the meds and it was pure Hell for about 2 or 3 months. one thing that did help ease the dizziness ,vomiting ect... was the hospital gave me a script for motion sickness, I don't remember the name but you can ask your DR.

"THIS IS A HORRIBLE DRUG!!!!! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!! DO NOT TAKE!!!I have watched my mother, who has never taken a recreational drug in her life struggle with this drug almost killing her (literally) from the withdrawl symptoms. She began taking it to treat her hot flashes and depression and built up to 225mg. All was well and wonderful, that is until she ran out of insurance, lost her company and could no longer afford the outrageously expensive drug. She stopped taking the drug and began to feel like she was shutting down, physically and mentally. I have struggled with opiate addiction for a few years now and i think there is no worse feeling than the withdrawl you experience when quitting. that was until i saw my mom go through this. she went to the hospital for what she was feeling (not knowing it was ecstapin withdrawl) and they told her that her body was literally shutting down. Once she started telling them the medication and dose she was on, they knew right away it was the ecstapin. since then she has only been able to ween down to 75mgs, due to the fact that YOU CAN LITERALLY DIE FROM THE WITHDRAWL OF THIS DRUG. She feels too awful when she tries to take any lower of a dose. She feels like she cant control any mental functions, she feels out of body, horrific nightmares, can't sleep right, complete physical drain, awful rages. And thats just the symptoms that wont actually kill you!!!Just take the time to research the class action lawsuit against Drugco.

My experience was that it was not very effective for treating the symptoms of depression, and once I made the decision with my doctor to discontinue use, the side effects of withdrawal were absolutely unbearable.

Even going from the smallest available dose (37.5 mg) to nothing was almost impossible - I had to break the capsules apart and count out the little pellets inside to make smaller reductions in dose. The doctor's suggestion to take 37.5 mg every other day was not helpful - it just meant that the  day off  was terrible. Please, please consider the severe side effects of this drug before using it.
